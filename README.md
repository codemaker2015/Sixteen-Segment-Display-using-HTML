Sixteen Segment Display
==============
Sixteen segment display control using the Html5 canvas

A sixteen-segment display (SISD) is a type of display based on 16 segments that can be turned on or off according to the graphic pattern to be produced. It is an extension of the more common seven-segment display, adding four diagonal and two vertical segments and splitting the three horizontal segments in half. Other variants include the fourteen-segment display which does not split the top or bottom horizontal segments, and the twenty two-segment display that allows lower-case characters with descenders.

Often a character generator is used to translate 7-bit ASCII character codes to the 16 bits that indicate which of the 16 segments to turn on or off.

Sixteen-segment displays were originally designed to display alphanumeric characters (Latin letters and Arabic digits). Later they were used to display Thai numerals and Persian characters. Non-electronic displays using this pattern existed as early as 1902.

Before the advent of inexpensive dot-matrix displays, sixteen and fourteen-segment displays were some of the few options available for producing alphanumeric characters on calculators and other embedded systems. However, they are still sometimes used on VCRs, car stereos, microwave ovens, telephone Caller ID displays, and slot machine readouts.

Sixteen-segment displays may be based on one of several technologies, the three most common optoelectronics types being LED, LCD and VFD. The LED variant is typically manufactured in single or dual character packages, to be combined as needed into text line displays of a suitable length for the application in question.

As with seven and fourteen-segment displays, a decimal point and/or comma may be present as an additional segment, or pair of segments; the comma (used for triple-digit groupings or as a decimal separator in many regions) is commonly formed by combining the decimal point with a closely 'attached' leftwards-descending arc-shaped segment. This way, a point or comma may be displayed between character positions instead of occupying a whole position by itself, which would be the case if employing the bottom middle vertical segment as a point and the bottom left diagonal segment as a comma. Such displays were very common on pinball machines for displaying the score and other information, before the widespread use of dot-matrix display panels.

Using the code
-------

The first step is to downloaded the code and include the script in your webpage. To add a sixteen segment display to your page create a new `SixteenSegment` object and pass the Canvas and number of display elements as parameters to the constructor. The canvas parameter is the only required argument. There are additional parameters you can pass to customize the display but they all have default values.

```xml
<canvas id='c' width='600' height='250'>Not supported</canvas>
<script src="segment.min.js"></script>

<script>
    var canvas = document.getElementById('c');
    var segment16 = new SixteenSegment(canvas, 6);
    segment16.DisplayText('Hello World');
 
    // This works too
    var segment16 = new SixteenSegment();
    segment16.Canvas = canvas;
    segment16.SetCount(6);
    segment16.DisplayText('Hello World');
</script>
```

Display Size
-------

By default the display will set its width and height equal to that of the canvas. This is convenient because the display automatically fills the canvas area and you can control the dimensions of the element in HTML and CSS. If you want to explicitly set the dimensions of the display you can set these properties manually.

```javascript
// Draws a sixteen segment display 200px wide and 100px tall
var segment16 = new SixteenSegment(canvas, 4, 200, 100);

// This works too
var segment16 = new SixteenSegment(canvas, 4);
segment16.Width = 200;
segment16.Height = 100;

// Display is 200px wide and fills the canvas height
var segment16 = new SixteenSegment(canvas, 4, 200);

// Display is 200px tall and fills the canvas width
var segment16 = new SixteenSegment(canvas, 4, null, 200);
```

Additionally you can set the position of the display on the canvas by adding x and y coordinates. These coordinates are relative to the top right corner of the canvas and default to (0,0).

```javascript
// Draws a sixteen segment display starting at position (100, 50);
var segment16 = new SixteenSegment(canvas, 4, 200, 100, 100, 50);
 
// This works too
var segment16 = new SixteenSegment(canvas, 4, 200, 100);
segment16.X = 100;
segment16.Y = 50;
```

Using these settings multiple displays can share the same canvas

```javascript
canvas.width = 410;
canvas.height = 100;
var segmentA = new SixteenSegment(canvas, 4, 200, 100, 0, 0);
var segmentB = new SixteenSegment(canvas, 4, 200, 100, 210, 0);
segmentA.DisplayText('Hello');
segmentB.DisplayText('World');
```

Customizing the display
-------

The display defaults to a standard looking sixteen segment display which I think looks pretty sharp.

If this meets your needs then you are all set. However if you want a display that looks a little different you have the ability to customize the look through several properties. The demo page lets you experiment with different settings to see how they affect rendering of the display.

```javascript
var segment = new SixteenSegment(canvas, 6);
segment.SegmentWidth = 0.16;          // Width of segments (% of Element Width)
segment.SegmentInterval = 0.05;       // Spacing between segments (% of Element Width)
segment.BevelWidth = .06;             // Size of corner bevel (% of Element Width)
segment.SideBevelEnabled = false;     // Determines if the sides should be beveled
segment.FillLight = '#86fd06'         // Color of an on segment
segment.FillDark = '#004400'          // Color of an off segment
segment.StrokeLight = '#007700'       // Color of an on segment outline
segment.StrokeDark = '#440044'        // Color of an off segment outline
segment.LineWidth = 0;                // Width of segment outline
segment.Padding = 10;                 // Padding around the display
segment.Spacing = 5;                  // Spacing between elements
segment.X = 0;                        // Starting position on the canvas
segment.Y = 0;
segment.Width = 200;                  // Size of the display
segment.Height = 100;
```

Custom Display Patterns
-------

Characters are mapped to display patterns through the `CharacterMasks` property. This property is a lookup object which holds display patterns indexed by character. The display pattern describes which segments should be turned on. This information is encoded in a 16 bit number as a bitmask with a bit for each segment. A 1 indicates that the segment should be turned on and a 0 indicates it should be turned off.

The `CharacterMasks` object contains display patterns for all alphanumeric characters. You can add additional characters or create your own custom display patterns by adding new values to the lookup. The value of the bitmask should be a 16 bit number with a bit set to 1 for each segment that should be turned on.

To display the character 'A' you need to turn on 8 segments.

```javascript
A: 1111001111000000
 
// Bitmask can be represented in several ways
var charMasks = SixteenSegment.prototype.CharacterMasks;
charMasks['A'] = a1 | a2 | b | c | g1 | g2 | e | f |;       // Segment masks
charMasks['A'] = parseInt('1111001111000000', 2);	    // Binary
charMasks['A'] = 0x3CF;					    // Hex
charMasks['A'] = 975;					    // Decimal 
```

The preferred way to set a display pattern is to use the segment bitmasks. A variable for each segment holds the bit that turns on its segment. When multiple segment masks are binary or'ed together you get a value the represents the desired pattern. This makes reading and creating new patterns very intuitive.

```javascript
// Bitmasks for individual segments
var a1 = 1 << 0,    a2 = 1 << 1,    b = 1 << 2,    c = 1 << 3,
    d1 = 1 << 4,    d2 = 1 << 5,    e = 1 << 6,    f = 1 << 7,
    g1 = 1 << 8,    g2 = 1 << 9,    h = 1 << 10,   i = 1 << 11,	
    j  = 1 << 12,   k  = 1 << 13,   l = 1 << 14,   m = 1 << 15;
 
// Turn on the g1 and g2 segments
charMasks['-'] = g1 | g2;      // 0000001100000000
```

Extending the Display
-------

The sixteen segment display is made up of three function objects. `SixteenSegment`, `SegmentCanvas`, and `SegmentArray`.

`SegmentArray` is responsible for setting the display patterns and storing the value of multiple elements. It is independent from rendering the control or drawing anything to a canvas. This object just manages setting the bit pattern for each element given a text input.

`SegementCanvas` provides generic functionality for drawing the display to the canvas. This includes properties for customizing the shape and position of the display. It requires that an inheriting object implement the details that define the shape and number of segments.

`SixteenSegment` extends the `SegmentCanvas` object with functionality specific to a sixteen segment display. This means it has to set two properties. The Points property defines the segment geometery for a sixteen segment layout. The `CharacterMasks` property provides a lookup that maps characters to their desired sixteen segment pattern.

This means that new display types can be created in the same way by extending the `SegmentCanvas` object and implementing the `Points[][]` array and `CharacterMasks` lookup. For instance itâ€™s pretty easy to add a seven segment display. The `SevenSegment` object contains only the code specific to defining its 'seven-ness'. All other code is reused.

```javascript
var seven = new SevenSegment(canvas, 6);
seven.DisplayText('Hello World');
```
